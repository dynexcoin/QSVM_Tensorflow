# Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) Tensorflow Class
A classical classiﬁcation model, Kernel-Support Vector machine, is implemented as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation problem. Here, data points are classiﬁed by a separating hyperplane while maximizing the function margin. The problem is solved for a public Banknote Authentication dataset.
